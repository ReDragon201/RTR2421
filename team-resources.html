								<h3>Team Info:</h3>
								<p>We are a FRC team made of schools in the Burke/Springfield area. Many teams are sponsored by a school and only allow people from that school to join. We are a community team that has students from Braddock, West Springfield, Lee, homeschooled children, and other schools. </p>

								<p>No experience is expected or required. There is something to do for everyone. A freshman may come in with no experience, and by Junior or Senior year becomes a team captain.</p>
									
								<p>Within our team we break down into smaller teams:</p>
								<ul>	
									<li>Build - mechanical design of the robot parts such as the drivetrain, shooter, climber, or intake.</li>
									<li>Electronics - wiring of the control systems, sensors, motors, and pneumatics</li>
									<li>Programming - Developing software to run the robot both autonomously and through driver control, including computer vision.</li>
									<p>*It is not necessary to commit to one group. People often move between groups depending on the phase or changing interests.</p>
								</ul>
								<p>During competition, things change. Even though a small team of 4 is the ones driving the robot, everyone else is involved in repairing and refreshing the robot between matches and scouting other teams.</p>

								

								<hr />

								<h4>Time commmitment:</h4>
								<p>We recognize people have other things to do. Our schedule is largely based on availability of our youth and mentors. Typically we meet two evenings during the week and then all day Saturday. Toward the competitions, we may meet more often, or individual teams may decide to meet. You do not need to come to all meetings, in fact most people don’t.</p>

								<p>There are few meetings outside the build season. Once the last competition is over we typically don’t get back together until October when we start with a few interest sessions to get the team back together for the next year.</p>
